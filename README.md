# Data_Visualization_Project
Bike share is a convenient mode of transportation that allows users to make trips using publicly available bikes. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making bike share ideal for short, one-way trips.
Citi Bike is largest bike sharing program in the United States. It is operated by NYC Bike Share, LLC, a subsidiary of Lyft, Inc.
The share program contains 20,000 bikes and 1300 stations across New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey. 

This project provides a detailed analysis of the Citi bike trip which will help the Citi bike admin team, city officials, the traffic department to improve the program & the riders in making important decisions for their daily ride.
